# OnePlus 6-6T HEVC Recording

This module enable HEVC/H265 video recording on OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T, install it via Magisk Manager. The bitrate value it's the same as H264 (42000000) and the HEVC code it's enabled only for video with resolution of 1080p and above.

## Bitrate reduction table

Since the average bitrate reduction it's about 59%, I'm planning on releasing another version of the module with a 50% bitrate value

| Codec | 480p | 720p | 1080p | 2160p|
|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|
| HEVC  | 52%  | 56%  | 62%   | 64%  |
