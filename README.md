This module enable HEVC/H265 video recording on OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T, install it via Magisk Manager. The bitrate values are the same as H264 and the HEVC code it's enabled for all the video profiles that previously used H264.
The audio codec it's still AAC and the audio bitrate doubles from 96 kb/s to 192 kb/s to get a better audio quality.
